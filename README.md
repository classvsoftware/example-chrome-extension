# Welcome to the Example Chrome Extension!

## [Install Example Chrome Extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/browser-extension-explore/jnofdoejfipgalklopidpdeofjebihcf)

This is a companion extension for the book [Building Browser Extensions by Matt Frisbie](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Browser-Extensions-Create-Firefox-ebook/dp/B0BN578YT5?maas=maas_adg_BE8EBDC1A30DF0DDA752B166D20FD557_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas). The extension contains a collection of open source examples demonstrating how
the various parts of browser extensions work.

In order to make the source code easy to understand, it intentionally
uses **zero** automated build tools. This means you can
clone this project and immediately load the extension into your browser
as-is.
