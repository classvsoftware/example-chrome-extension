# Welcome to the Browser Extension Explorer!

## [Install Browser Extension Explorer for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/browser-extension-explore/jnofdoejfipgalklopidpdeofjebihcf)

This is a companion extension for the book [Building Browser Extensions by Matt Frisbie](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Browser-Extensions-Create-Firefox/dp/148428724X). The extension contains a collection of open source examples demonstrating how
the various parts of browser extensions work.

In order to make the source code easy to understand, it intentionally
uses **zero** automated build tools. This means you can
clone this project and immediately load the extension into your browser
as-is.
